## Note:

During the development of the project, most of the work was done quickly, which led to some unstructured commits and
potentially less-than-ideal coding practices. Here are a few points to note about the current state :

#### 1. Commit Structure:

The commits are not well-defined, as I was focusing on functionality rather than versioning best practices. Ideally,
each feature would have its own isolated commit, but due to the rapid development, this wasn't fully achieved.

#### 2. Code Quality:

The code may have some bad practices and coding smells, as my priority was to meet functionality goals. There are still
areas that need refactoring and optimization.

#### 3. Work in Progress:

Several features are still not being implemented ..
